<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a student majoring in Automation (UWA Joint Program) at the School of Computer Science, Southwest University in Chongqing, China.Ranking 4/102 students([[Link]](https://github.com/Sanjin72W/Sanjin72W.github.io/blob/main/images/ranking_222022321132054_2025-04-02.pdf)) with a GPA of 4.3/5([[Link]](https://github.com/Sanjin72W/Sanjin72W.github.io/blob/main/images/GPA_222022321132054_2025-04-02.pdf)) and working in the Multimedia Digital Technology Laboratory under the supervision of Prof. Xiaoqin Tang[[Link]](https://cis.swu.edu.cn/info/1014/4462.htm).

My research primarily focuses on 2D/3D CT reconstruction and MRI reconstruction. I am proficient in PyTorch and C, and also experienced in MATLAB. I have a solid understanding of the fundamental frameworks behind algorithms such as diffusion models and 3DGS, with particularly deep insights into the NeRF framework.


My research interest includes: 
- Biomedical image reconstruction 
- Accelerate INR

-	Paper's Contribution: A coarse reconstruction is achieved within seconds by designing a CUDA-based Target Prior Estimator (TPE), and a Target Prior Structure Encoder (TPSE) is used to extract structural prior embeddings from TPE to enhance the input encoding. This leads to a qualitative breakthrough in implicit learning-based 3D cone-beam CT reconstruction under sparse-view conditions.
-	My Contribution: TPSE is designed to pre-extract structural features without relying on a trainable network.
