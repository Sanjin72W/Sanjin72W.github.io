<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a student majoring in Automation (University of Western Australia Joint Program) at the School of Computer And Information Science, Southwest University in Chongqing, China. Ranking 4/102 students with a GPA of 4.3/5 and working in the Multimedia Digital Technology Laboratory under the supervision of Prof. Xiaoqin Tang[[Link]](https://cis.swu.edu.cn/info/1014/4462.htm).

My research primarily focuses on 2D and 3D CT reconstruction as well as 2D MRI reconstruction. In particular, for sparse‚Äêview CT, our work has already achieved superior imaging quality with just 12 views. I am proficient in PyTorch and C, and also experienced in MATLAB. I have a solid understanding of the fundamental frameworks behind algorithms such as diffusion models and 3DGSÔºàunderstood at the implementation level; haven‚Äôt examined the underlying principlesÔºâ, with particularly deep insights into the NeRF framework.


My research interest includes: 
- Biomedical image reconstruction 
- Accelerate INR

-	My Contribution: Developed a vanilla version of Target Prior-guided Voxel Sampling (TPVS), which leverages target priors to avoid wasting sampling points in air regions. (My co-author further refined the theoretical framework to enable adaptive acquisition of high-frequency information; while the vanilla version primarily speeds up convergence, the optimized method also delivers significant reconstruction-quality gains for CT with over 30 views.)
